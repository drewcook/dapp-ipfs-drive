# IPFS Drive

This application is a Web3 product that allows users to upload their files to [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and view them in a dashboard, very similar to Google Drive. However, this application is decentralized and allows users to interact with Web3.

This is a very simple product aimed to deliver a proof of concept for uploading and viewing files within IPFS in a web application built with JavaScript.
